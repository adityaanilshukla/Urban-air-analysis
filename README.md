# Urban Air Analysis

**Exploration of how pollutants affect NO₂ levels in urban environments**

---

## Project Overview

This project investigates the relationship between various air pollutants and nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) concentrations in urban areas. It aims to identify trends, correlations, and potential insights related to environmental quality and public health.

## Repository Contents

- **`AirQuality.csv`** – Dataset containing pollutant measurements including NO₂, timestamps, and possibly location or other variables.
- **`data_science.ipynb`** – Jupyter Notebook with exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and analytical findings.
- **`data_science.pdf`** – PDF export of the notebook—useful for sharing or reviewing results without running code.

## Results Summary

- Observed a strong correlation between NO₂ and traffic-related pollutants.
- NO₂ levels peak during morning and evening rush hours.
- Seasonal variations from early analysis suggest higher NO₂ in winter months.
